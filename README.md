# Multi-Agent Data Collection and Summarization System

This project implements an agent-based system that leverages LlamaIndex and MCP servers to perform automated data collection, processing, and presentation tasks. The system supports multi-agent collaboration for research and summarization workflows.

## Features

- Multi-agent architecture for distributed data collection and processing
- Integration with MCP servers for data management
- Utilization of LlamaIndex for intelligent data indexing and querying
- Automated summarization and visualization of data
- Text-to-speech capabilities for presentation

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- llama-index
- mcp-server-client
- playwright
- networkx
- matplotlib
- pyttsx3
- openai
- requests

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Playwright browsers (if needed):

```bash
python -m playwright install
```

## Usage

To run the system, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Ensure that any necessary configuration (e.g., API keys, server URLs) are set within the scripts or environment variables as appropriate.

## Files

- `main.py`: Entry point for orchestrating the agents and workflows.
- `tools.py`: Utility functions for data processing, visualization, and speech synthesis.
- `agent.py`: Defines agent classes responsible for specific tasks such as data collection, processing, and summarization.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all required dependencies.

## Example

Below is a high-level example of how the system initializes and runs:

```python
from main import run_system

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_system()
```
